### Time Complexity
- It is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run
- as a function of length of the input

#### represent
-  Big O notations ( Upper Bound )
-  Theta θ         ( for average case complexity )
-  Omega Ω         ( Lower Bound )

#### representation
- Conatant time  -> O(1)
- Linear time    -> O(n)
- Logrithm time  -> O(logn)
- Quadratic time -> O<sup>2</sup>
- Cubic time     -> O<sup>3</sup>
